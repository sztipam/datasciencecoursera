## Formula Fitting

Based on the information given the selected formula for this analysis
was selected to be an independent combination of the recorded belt 
acceleration dimentions.

This data was first fit by a linear model. The following distributions
compare the prediction with the recorded data.

A second fit was attempted with a resampling of the training set.
Below is a distribution of the resulting prediction.

## Predictions

Although the choice may be more subjective then obvious, the second 
fit seems to give a mildly closer approximation. It was selected as
the predictive model to apply to the testing set. The result are below,
