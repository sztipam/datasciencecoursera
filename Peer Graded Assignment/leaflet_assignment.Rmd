For my Leaflet assignment I selected five out of the top seven
chocolate consuming countries per capita. I was looking for
top chocolate consuming nations. I cut off the top two for
security puposes. The diameter of each circle represents 
100000 times the amount of chocolate eaten in the country 
that the circle is centered above in kilograms per person.

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
m.data<-read.csv("per-capita-consumption-of-chocolate-in-selected-countries-in-2007.csv")
kpp<-m.data$data
m.data %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircles(weight = 1, radius = kpp * 100000)
```
